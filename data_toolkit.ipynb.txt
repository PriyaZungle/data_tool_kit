How does broadcasting work in numpy?\n","- Broadcasting applies specific rules to determine whether two arrays can be aligned for operations: Check Dimensions: Ensure the arrays have the same number of dimensions or expandable dimensions.\n","- Dimension Padding: If arrays have different numbers of dimensions, the smaller array is left-padded with ones.\n","\n","3. what is a pandas dataframe?\n","- pandas DataFrame is a way to represent and work with tabular data. It can be seen as a table that organizes data into rows and columns, making it a two-dimensional data structure.\n","- A DataFrame can be created from scratch, or you can use other data structures, like NumPy arrays\n","\n","4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n","- The groupby function in Pandas is a tool that helps you organize data into groups based on certain criteria, like the values in a column. - - - This makes it easier to analyze and summarize your data.\n","\n","5. Why is Seoborn preferrd for statical visualization?\n","- The power of Seaborn lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate with pandas, one of Python's most popular libraries for data manipulation. - - This integration allows users to visualize pandas DataFrames directly, making the transition from data analysis to data visualization incredibly smooth\n","\n","6. What are the differences between numpy arrays and python lists?\n","- The main difference is that NumPy arrays are much faster and have strict requirements on the homogeneity of the objects.\n","- For example, a NumPy array of strings can only contain strings and no other data types, but a Python list can contain a mixture of strings, numbers, booleans and other objects\n","\n","7. What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n","- What is a Heat map? | insightsoftwareA heatmap is a visual representation of data that uses color to show the distribution of values. Heatmaps are used to analyze complex data sets and identify patterns and correlations.\n","- They can be used in many fields, including marketing, finance, healthcare, and logistic\n","\n","8. What does the term \"vectorized operation\"mean in numpy?\n","- Vectorization in NumPy is a method of performing operations on entire arrays without explicit loops.\n","- This approach leverages NumPy's underlying C implementation for faster and more efficient computations.\n","- By replacing iterative processes with vectorized functions, you can significantly optimize perf.\n","\n","9. How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n","- Matplotlib is more explicit in declaring each plot element, making it an ideal place for new Python users to start, while Plotly is well-suited for creating interactive plots to be displayed in a web browser.\n","\n","10. What is the significe of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n","-  In pandas, MultiIndexes can help to provide optimized queries and preserve relationships.\n","- MultiIndexes are themselves data values, and pandas handles them as such in queries, but the full contents of a hierarchical index are displayable in the results view.\n","\n","11. What is the role of Seaborn's pairplot() function?\n","- Seaborn's pairplot() function is used to visualize the pairwise relationships between all numeric variables within a dataset, creating a grid of scatter plots where each cell shows the relationship between two variables, making it a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to quickly identify potential correlations or patterns between multiple features.\n","\n","12. What is the purpose to describe() function in Pandas?\n","- The describe() function in Pandas is used to generate a summary of descriptive statistics for each column in a DataFrame, providing a quick overview of the data's central tendency, dispersion, and shape by calculating metrics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles for each numerical column.\n","\n","13. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n","- Handling missing data in Pandas is important because it can affect the accuracy of your analysis and conclusions.\n","- Missing data can skew results, lead to errors, and make it difficult for machine learning models to work.\n","\n","14. What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n","- It allows you to create interactive and customizable charts easily. - - Plotly supports various chart types and integrates seamlessly with Python, R, and JavaScript.\n","- Its interactive features, like zoom and hover, enhance data exploration, and you can share your visualizations online, making it great for collaboration.\n","\n","15. How does numpy handle multidimensional array?\n","- For numpy, all data in any multi-dimensional array is actually stored in memory as a long 1D array (we will get back to this in the master lecture).\n","- The number of dimensions and shape of an array is actually only used to structure the data access in a certain way.\n","\n","16. What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization ?\n","- Bokeh is a Python library primarily used to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations within web browsers, allowing users to build dynamic graphics, dashboards, and applications with features like zooming, panning, and tooltips, making it particularly useful for exploring large or streaming datasets with interactive elements.\n","\n","17. Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas.\n","- While map is great for simple element-wise transformations in Series, apply offers more flexibility for both Series and DataFrame objects.\n","- On the other hand, applymap excels at DataFrame-wide element-wise operations.\n","\n","18. What are some advance feature of numpy ?\n","- Some advanced features of NumPy include broadcasting, linear algebra, and advanced array indexing.\n","\n","19. How does Panda simplify time series analysis?\n","- Combining the ease of use of dateutil and datetime modules and the vectorized interface and efficient storage of NumPy's datetime64, pandas provides a Timestamp object.\n","- The library then makes a DatetimeIndex from these Timestamp objects to index a DataFrame or Series.\n","\n","20. What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?\n","- A PivotTable is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data.\n","- You can use a PivotTable to analyze numerical data in detail, and answer unanticipated questions about your data.\n","- A PivotTable is especially designed for: Querying large amounts of data in many user-friendly ways\n","\n","21. Why is NumPy's array slicing faster than Python's list slicing?\n","- NumPy arrays are optimized for numerical computations, with efficient element-wise operations and mathematical functions.\n","- These operations are implemented in C, resulting in faster performance than equivalent operations on lists.\n","\n","22.
